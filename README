  authentication/loss reporting/bandwidth limit enforcement using AMBI.

REQUIREMENTS

  To bootstrap from a Git checkout, or if you change the Automake files
  and need to regenerate Makefile.in, you will need Automake 1.11 or
  later.  For bootstrap or if you change configure.ac or any of the m4
  files it includes and need to regenerate configure or config.h.in, you
  will need Autoconf 2.60 or later.  A C compiler is also probably
  required before it's useful.

BUILDING

  To regenerate from scratch:

      ./autogen.sh
      ./configure
      make
      make check

  To install:

      make install

  Pass --enable-logging to configure to enable logging functionality.

  Pass --enable-debug to configure to enable debug messages.

TESTING

  libmcrx comes with a test suite, which you can run after building
  with:

      make check
